# psf
Perfect Sequence Finder (psf) - finds constructions for perfect sequences and arrays. This program is a spin-off of numerous different programs I have been running since mid 2006. Many details of this program are given in my [PhD thesis](https://monash.figshare.com/articles/Constructions_for_Perfect_Autocorrelation_Sequences_and_Multi-Dimensional_Arrays/4903103), in particular Chapter 9. 

The goal of this project is to find a perfect sequence which is longer than the Frank sequences, length n^2 over n roots of unity. For example, the discovery of a sequence of length 216 over 6 roots of unity. It is presently unknown if such sequences exist, however they would have immediate applications in communications, providing the phase is not too large. 

This program searches for n-phase two dimensional arrays with perfect periodic autocorrelation. The index function of the array is of the form 

S(i,j) = \omega^{\sum_{k=1}^{N}floor(p_k(x,y)/d_k)}, 

where \omega = e^(2 \pi \sqrt{-1}/n), p_k(x,y) are bivariate polyomials and d_k \elem Z_n. Per Ma, Ng "On non-existence of perfect and nearly perfect sequences", *Int. J. Information and Coding Theory, Vol. 1, No. 1, 2009*, n should not be prime. The polynomials, p_k(x,y), and denominators are randomly generated within user-specified constraints. 

The program requires you to specify the following: 

* The minimum and maximum number of phases. For example: *phases = [6,8,12]* 

* Bounds on the number of elements in the arrays. For example: *size_ranges = [[36,1296]]* will generate arrays with all sizes between 36 and 1296. 

* The modulus of the d_k's and p_k(x,y)'s. By default the modulus is the phase of the array. For example: *modulus = 'Automatic'* will use the array phase. 

* The denominators, by default are generated randomly in Z_n. However they can be user-specified. For example: *denominators = [2,3,5]*. 

* The number of trials for each configuration of phase, array size, and denominator. For example, *n_trials = 100*. 

* The number of sums, N. For example *n_sums = 2*.

* The maximum degree of the polynomial *p_k(x,y)* in *x*. For example *degX = 2*. 

* The maximum degree of the polynomial *p_k(x,y)* in *y*. For example *degY = 2*. 

* The tolerance for a perfect array. For example: *tol_perfect = 0.01* specifies that the off-peak shifts be 1% or less of the peak. 

* A flag to specify that the array is square: *square_only = True*. By default *square_only = False*. 

* A flag to specify that the dimensions of the arrays are coprime only. *diagonal_only = True*. By default *diagonal_only = False*. 

If a perfect array is found the array is then checked for the Array Orthogonality Property. If so, a perfect sequence has been discovered. If the array has coprime dimensions then a perfect sequence has been discovered. 

Numerous examples are given in searches.py. 

Running this program with efficient correlations uses [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/). Instructions for installing FFTW using brew is given at https://brewformulas.org/Fftw and instructions for the installation of pyfftw is given at https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW. 

Alternatively you can use [FFTpack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/fftpack.html) by replacing *crosscorrelate_fftw* with *crosscorrelate_fftpack* in *max_abs_off_peak()*. 

In the near future I'll test out replacing the **C** code for *fill_array_2d* with a numba compiled python equivalent. Ideally this should not slow down the program too much, if at all, while making everything significantly simpler.
